# 2.2 - 2.3 Migration: requivsumfrac
# ============================
# 
# The 2.3 release replaces the `requivsum` constraint with the fractional [requivsumfrac](../api/phoebe.parameters.constraint.requivsumfrac.md) constraint.  The `requivsum` constraint was not added to a system by default in earlier versions and was not well-advertised, so has been removed entirely in favor of the fractional version.
