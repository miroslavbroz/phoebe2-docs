# # 2.3 - 2.4 Migration: updates to EBAI
# 
# The 2.4 release introduces an extra keyword: `ebai_method` that supports the choice of `mlp` (which uses the same AI model as 2.3) or `knn` (which is a new trained kNeighborsRegressor model). The `knn` option also allows for estimating parameters of contact binaries.
