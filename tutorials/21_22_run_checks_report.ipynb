Although this saved a bit of time, it often resulted in confusion as it was impossible to expose additional errors until fixing the first one.\n",

This object has a `.passed` attribute which can be used in the same way as the boolean returned in 2.1.  Additionally, if you print the returned object, you'll see a full list of all errors/warnings.\n",
